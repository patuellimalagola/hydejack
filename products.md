Our products are processed and sold via various cooperatives. We are planning to start selling part of our produce directly to the public.

We currently produce:

### Wheat

Common wheat ([Triticum aestivum](http://www.agraria.org/coltivazionierbacee/granotenero.htm)) is the cereal commonly used for bread making. Wheat grains can also be cooked whole to make soups, salads or the great 'pastiera napoletana', a traditional cake from Naples. 

We grow wheat of the variety 'Rebelde', 'Bologna', 'Rubisko'. Our wheat is processed by the local [Consorzio Agrario](https://www.consorzioagrarioravenna.it/).  

Odd fact: wheat is a genetic monster! Learn more by watching [this video](https://youtu.be/BXF11C_B-HM) or, if you understand any Italian, by reading [the original article](http://bressanini-lescienze.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2016/03/24/quel-mostro-genetico-chiamato-frumento/).

### Chickpeas    
<img src="/images/chickpeas.png" alt="Ceci" style="width:150px;height:150px;" align="right">    

Chipeas ([Cicer arietinum](http://www.agraria.org/coltivazionierbacee/cece.htm)) are a commonly cultivated pulse. Chickpeas are a nutritious food and very versatile. You can use chickpeas in soups, salads, but also to make hummus, falafel or a delicious [chana masala](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/24/how-to-make-the-perfect-chana-masala).  

Our chickpeas, of the 'Pascià' variety, are processed on the day of harvesting and distributed by [Conserve Italia](https://www.conserveitalia.it/en/). If you have ever bought a can of chickpeas of the Valfrutta brand there's a chance you have already tried our chickpeas.      

Odd fact: some say Marcus Tullius Cicero, the famous Roman orator, owes his second name to [a chickpea-shaped wart on his nose](https://www.etimo.it/?term=cicerone), as 'cicer' means chickpea in Latin.

Green peas ([Pisum sativum](http://www.agraria.org/coltivazionierbacee/pisello.htm)) are a pulse used for both human and cattle feed. As food for us humans, peas are great with pasta, steamed or boiled as a side dish or in the Italian classic 'seppie e piselli' (cuttlefish and peas). 
  
We grow 'Wolf' peas, which are processed and distributed by [Conserve Italia](https://www.conserveitalia.it/en/).  

Odd fact: green peas were [a fashion fad at the court of Louis XIV](https://www.laterza.it/index.php?option=com_laterza&Itemid=97&task=schedalibro&isbn=9788842091011), so much so that ladies asked for an extra serving to eat before bed, even after opulent dinners.

### Alfalfa    
<img src="/images/alfalfa.png" alt="Erba medica" style="width:150px;height:150px;" align="right">   
Alfalfa ([Medicago sativa](http://www.agraria.org/coltivazionierbacee/erbamedica.htm)), also known ad lucerne, is one of the most important forage crops. Emilia-Romagna is particularly well suited for growing alfalfa. 

We grow 'Gea' alfalfa. The seeds are processed by [Continental Semences](http://www.continentalsemences.com/Inglese/Index.html).

Odd fact: alfalfa is not meant to be eaten by humans, but some just can't resist and [have to eat the sprouts](https://alivebynature.com/the-right-way-to-eat-alfalfa-sprouts/).

### Trebbiano grapes
<img src="/images/trebbiano.jpg" alt="Trebbiano" style="width:120px;height:120px;" align="right">  
Trebbiano is an Italian white grape, used for wine making. It is a component of many Italian DOC (Controlled Origin Denomination) wines, and on his own it forms seven Trebbiano DOCs, amongst which [Trebbiano di Romagna DOC](http://www.consorziovinidiromagna.it/vini/trebbiano/).

Our grapes, once harvested, are turned into wine by [Agrintesa](http://www.agrintesa.it/).   

Odd fact: the name 'Trebbiano' comes from 'trebulanum', which featured first in [Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia](https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Naturalis_Historia/Liber_XIV), and supposedly refers to Trebula Balliensis, the modern [Treglia](https://goo.gl/maps/QLaEGcHLUHx).
